# n-body Simulation
N-body simulation for performance timing

## Summary
A n-body simulation modeling the (simplified) affect  the interacting 
gravitational pull of the object on each other in 2-D space.

The program times the difference, for varying numbers of objects, between the 
simulation using the results of Newtons third law to halve the number of 
calculations and the time needed without that optimization.
